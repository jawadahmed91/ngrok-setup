## üåê Exposing the App to Public Internet

We use **Ngrok** to share your local app securely.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Ngrok

```bash
sudo snap install ngrok
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connect Ngrok to your account
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken {YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Ngrok Tunnel
If your web server runs on port 80:

```bash
ngrok http --host-header=chat-microservice-app.local 80
```

This command forwards requests and preserves the host header.

You will get a forwarding URL like:

```bash
https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

Anyone with this URL can access your app.

### üí° Notes

Update your .env:
```bash
APP_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

Remember to restart your app/server if needed.
Ngrok tunnels are temporary‚Äîrestart Ngrok if your session expires.
